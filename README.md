# heart.py

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics module to draw a heart shape based on mathematical functions. The heart's shape is generated using parametric equations for the X and Y coordinates, which are defined in the hearta(k) and heartb(k) functions, respectively. The heart is drawn using a continuous loop and rendered in a bright pink color against a black background.

Key features:
    The parametric functions create the distinctive heart curve.
    The Turtle graphics library animates the drawing process.
    The background is set to black, and the heart is filled with a pink color for visual contrast.

This project showcases how mathematical equations can be visualized using Turtle graphics in Python, and it makes use of customization in colors and speed for aesthetic appeal.
